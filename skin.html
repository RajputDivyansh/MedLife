<p style="font-size:80px; text-align:center; padding-top:0; color:white;">SKIN CONDITIONS</p>
</div>

<div class="content">
<h1 align="center">WHAT CAUSES SKIN CONDITIONS?</h1>
<img src="Images/skin1.jpg" align="middle">
<p>A number of skin conditions last a long time. Some may start in childhood and continue into adulthood. In some cases, the condition will not always be present but will flare up at certain times.<br>
Allergies, irritants, genetic makeup, certain diseases, and immune system problems can cause skin conditions.
</p>
<h1 align="center">WHAT IS ACNE?</h1>
<img src="Images/skin2.jpg" align="middle">
<p>
Acne is a disorder that affects the skin’s oil glands and hair follicles. The small holes in your skin (pores) connect to oil glands under the skin. These glands make an oily substance called sebum. The pores connect to the glands by a canal called a follicle. Inside the follicles, oil carries dead skin cells to the surface of the skin. A thin hair also grows through the follicle and out to the skin. Sometimes, the hair, sebum, and skin cells clump together into a plug. The bacteria in the plug cause swelling. Then when the plug starts to break down, a pimple grows.
<br>
Most pimples are found on the face, neck, back, chest, and shoulders. Acne is usually not a serious health threat, but it can cause scars.</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">WHAT IS VITILIGO?</h1>
<img src="Images/skin3.jpg" align="middle">
<p>
Vitiligo is the loss of pigmentation in the skin. White patches of skin are the main symptom of vitiligo, and more commonly appear in areas where the skin is exposed to sunlight. People with vitiligo often lose their hair color early as well.
</p>
For some people, the symptoms are in one area, while others find that it spreads slowly over many years. There is no known cure for vitiligo. There are some medical and surgical treatment options, though they are not right for everyone.</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">WHAT IS ECZEMA?</h1>
<img src="Images/skin4.jpg" align="middle">
<p>The condition is commonly found in infants and young children, though it continues into adulthood as well. Symptoms include rashes on the face, scalp, behind the elbows, or on the neck, wrists, ankles, or legs.
<br>
The rashes are very itchy and may become bumpy, change color, or thicken. In adults, the rashes may cover more of the body, causing very dry skin that is permanently itchy.
<br>
There are a few different types of eczema, each causing their own symptoms. There is no known cure for eczema. It either clears up on its own or the symptoms are treated with medications and creams</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">WHAT IS MELANOMA?</h1>
<img src="Images/skin5.jpg" align="middle">
<p>Abnormal moles may lead to melanoma, a serious and life-threatening skin cancer.

If moles have asymmetrical shapes, ragged edges, uneven colors, or change in size, they should be checked.

Patients with melanoma may have surgery, or undergo chemotherapy or radiation treatments.</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">WHAT ARE MOLES?</h1>
<img src="Images/skin6.jpg" align="middle">
<p>Common growths on the skin that appear when the skin cells bunch up with tissue surrounding them.
<br>
Most people have moles and may develop new ones from time to time.
<br>
Moles have no symptoms, but should be regularly checked if they grow larger, appear abnormal, or change in color.</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">WHAT ARE SEBORRHEIC DERMATICS?</h1>
<img src="Images/skin7.jpg" align="middle">
<p>In babies, this is commonly known as cradle cap. Greasy and scaly patches of skin form on the baby's skin, most commonly on the scalp. It is harmless and usually goes away on its own.
<br>
In adults, seborrheic dermatitis may appear anywhere, and is prone to flare up and disappear for the rest of a person's life. The affected skin may be reddish, swollen, and appear greasy. A white-to-yellow crust may appear on the surface of the skin as well. Many treatments help to bring relief from symptoms.
</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">SUMMARY</h1>
<p>When facing any skin disorder, it is important for people not to do so alone. Teaming up with a doctor or dermatologist to diagnose any skin disease is the only way to be sure it is correctly diagnosed and dealt with.</p>
