<img src="Images/dental1.jpg" align="middle">
<p>We all know the basics when it comes to keeping your teeth healthy: brush, floss, visit the dentist twice a year. But there are habits and lifestyle choices that could be harming your dental health that will surprise you.
<br>
In this article, you will learn some of the nasty habits to avoid to protect your teeth from tooth decay and discoloration. Learn what causes teeth grinding, the best ways to keep your teeth white, and how to avoid cavities by making simple, effective changes to your daily habits.
</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">THE IMPORTANCE OF DENTAL HYGIENE</h1>
<img src="Images/dental8.jpg" align="middle">
<p>Besides smiling, laughing, and communicating, the mouth and teeth serve important functions in the body. Teeth and saliva break down food, making it easier for the stomach to process it further for absorption by the intestines. The teeth provide structural support for the face. The mouth and throat contain immune cells that help protect the body against pathogens. Taking good care of the mouth and teeth is an essential part of maintaining good health. Here is a guide to some common oral health problems and procedures.

</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">BAD DENTAL HABIT: GUMMY CANDY</h1>
<img src="Images/dental2.jpg" align="middle">
<p>
Most people know that sugar can lead to cavities. But some sugary foods are worse than others. Candy that sticks to the teeth can get stuck between the crevices of a tooth, and saliva can’t wash it away. Some sugary treats to avoid includegummy candies (gummy bears, gummy worms, etc.),caramels,raisins and other dried fruits, andjelly beans.
<br>
Most of these candies can be found in sugar-free varieties. Choose these instead for healthier teeth. At a minimum, good tooth brushing and flossing after consuming these goodies can help, too.

</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">BAD DENTAL HABIT: SODA</h1>
<img src="Images/dental3.jpg" align="middle">
<p>
High sugar and acid content make for a bad combination for your teeth. Frequent soda drinking will essentially bathe your teeth in sugar and can lead to dental decay.
Additionally, increased acid exposure works to erode tooth enamel and can lead to teeth sensitivity.</p>
For some people, the symptoms are in one area, while others find that it spreads slowly over many years. There is no known cure for vitiligo. There are some medical and surgical treatment options, though they are not right for everyone.</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">BAD DENTAL HABIT: TEARING INTO PACKAGING WITH TEETH</h1>
<img src="Images/dental4.jpg" align="middle">
<p>Teeth are meant for eating and smiling! Any other use can be unhealthy; your teeth are not knives, and they’re not scissors either.
<br>
Although it may seem convenient in the short term, opening potato chip bags, bobby pins, or even bottle caps with your teeth can cause teeth to chip or fracture. To save your teeth, reach for the proper tools for such tasks instead.

</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">BAD DENTAL HABIT: DRINKING COFFEE</h1>
<img src="Images/dental5.jpg" align="middle">
<p>A morning cup of coffee helps many of us start the day. Unfortunately, caffeine can interfere with saliva flow, cause a dry mouth, and lead to tooth decay.
<br>
Also, adding sugar to your brew increases the risk of tooth decay even more. To counteract the effect of a dry mouth from caffeine, drink water frequently throughout the day.

</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">BAD DENTAL HABIT: SMOKING</h1>
<img src="Images/dental7.jpg" align="middle">
<p>CDid you need another reason to quit smoking? Well, here’s one: Tobacco use dries out the mouth and increases the amount of plaque buildup around our teeth. Smokers are more likely to lose teeth compared to nonsmokers due to gum disease.

Additionally, tobacco use is a big risk factor for oral cancer. To increase your chances of success in kicking this unhealthy habit, seek help from your doctor.</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">BAD DENTAL HABIT: BINGE EATING</h1>
<img src="Images/dental6.jpg" align="middle">
<p>Binge eating usually involves consuming large amounts of sugary foods and drinks, which may lead to dental decay.

Binge eating may also occur with another eating disorder such as bulimia, in which the food is purged by vomiting. Because vomit is highly acidic, it can erode and damage teeth over time.
<br>
Medical care and intervention are important to address these eating disorders. Unfortunately, many who suffer from binge eating disorder do their best to hide their condition from close friends and family, making it hard to ask for help. But asking for help from a trusted medical professional is the first step to getting proper treatment.
<br>
Treatment for binge eating disorder should be discussed with a professional psychiatrist, psychologist or other mental health professional. Therapy for changing eating habits, as well as your thoughts and feelings that contribute to your binge eating, may include one or more approaches, including:cognitive behavioral therapy,interpersonal therapy, and dialectical behavior therapy</p>
