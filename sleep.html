<p style="font-size:80px; text-align:center; padding-top:0; color:white;">SLEEP DISORDER</p>
</div>

<div class="content">
<h1 align="center">WHAT ARE SLEEP DISORDERS?</h1>
<img src="Images/sleep1.jpg" align="middle">
<p>
Sleep disorders are conditions that impair a person's ability to get normal restorative sleep. The causes of these conditions are variable and range from habits people have developed before they go to sleep to a number of medical problems that disrupt the normal sleep cycle. If you notice you have a pattern of not feeling rested in the mornings after you wake up, you should probably see your doctor to determine if you have a sleep disorder. Sleep disorders can have a profound effect on a person’s overall health.

</p>
<h1 align="center">WHY IS SLEEP IMPORTANT?</h1>
<img src="Images/sleep2.jpg" align="middle">
<p>
Lack of sleep can be life-threatening! For example, car accidents, personal problems, poor job performance, injuries, memory problems, and mood disorders have been linked to poor sleep. In addition, researchers have concluded sleep disorders likely contribute to heart disease, obesity, and diabetes.
</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">SYMPTOMS OF SLEEP DISORDERS</h1>
<img src="Images/sleep3.jpg" align="middle">
<p>
Symptoms of sleep disorders vary depending on the type of sleep disorder. The symptoms may range from mild to severe and usually include one or more of the following: hypersomnia (excessive daytime sleepiness), insomnia (decreased sleep efficiency with unrestful sleep with frequent waking up in the night), loud snoring and/or brief pauses in breathing (short periods of apnea), leg movements or an urge to move the legs at night, sleepwalking, or night terrors (nightmares).</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">THE SLEEP CYCLE</h1>
<img src="Images/sleep4.jpg" align="middle">
<p>A normal sleep cycle has two major categories termed REM and non-REM. REM stands for rapid eye movement. REM sleep is characterized by muscle relaxation, dreaming, episodic rapid eye movements, and low amplitude waves on an EEG (encephalograph). Non-REM sleep is divided into four stages from light sleep (stage 1) to stage IV (Delta or deep sleep). Non-REM sleep occupies about 75% of normal sleeping time while REM occupies the remaining 25% and usually occurs more toward morning. Sleep disorders disrupt these sleep cycles.
</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">HOW MUCH SLEEP DO I NEED?</h1>
<img src="Images/sleep5.jpg" align="middle">
<p>The sleeping time needs of individuals are variable, and sleep times vary between kids and adults.

<br>
<b>Adults</b>
Some adults can vary in their sleep requirements from about 5 to as many as 10 hours per night. However, several studies have suggested the majority of normal adults average about 7 to 8 hours per night.

<br>
<b>Younger People</b>
In general, the younger the person, the more sleep they need. For example, teenagers require about nine hours of sleep while infants require about 16 hours per night.

</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">WHAT IS INSOMNIA?</h1>
<img src="Images/sleep6.jpg" align="middle">
<p>Insomnia is the inability to initiate or maintain sleep. Most people in their lifetime will have some difficulty falling asleep occasionally. However, if trouble falling asleep occurs either frequently or steadily, the individual may have insomnia. People with insomnia have difficulty falling asleep, sometimes for hours at a time, and they may wake up too early or they may wake up repeatedly through the night. Insomnia is considered the most common sleep disorder in the U.S. and studies suggest as many as 95% of Americans have reported an episode of insomnia at some time during their life.</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">CAUSES OF INSOMNIA: SLEEP HYGIENES</h1>
<img src="Images/sleep7.jpg" align="middle">
<p>Poor sleep hygiene refers to bad habits that interfere with an individual's ability to fall asleep. For example, drinking coffee or other caffeinated drinks in the evening, smoking, eating heavy foods late in the evening, falling asleep with the lights on and/or leaving the television on, or using a cell phone, computer, or tablet right before bed are bad habits or poor sleep hygiene can lead to insomnia.

</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">CAUSES OF INSOMNIA: MENTAL HEALTH</h1>
<img src="Images/sleep8.jpg" align="middle">
<p>Poor sleep hygiene is not the only cause of insomnia. Mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and stress (for example, posttraumatic stress disorder, loss of spouse or financial problems) may also cause insomnia. In addition, medications used to treat some of these mental health problems may also cause or increase sleep problems. Discuss any sleep-related problems you think are caused by medications with your physician.</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">SLEEPWALKING (SOMNAMBULISM)</h1>
<img src="Images/sleep9.jpg" align="middle">
<p>Sleepwalking, also known as somnambulism, is a behavior disorder that occurs during deep sleep and results in an individual either walking or performing complex behaviors while still asleep. Sleepwalking is more common in children than in adults and more likely to occur in people who are sleep deprived. The person may be difficult to awaken and will likely not remember anything about sleepwalking once they wake up.</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">HOW TO SLEEP BETTER: EXERCISE</h1>
<img src="Images/sleep10.jpg" align="middle">
<p>Regular exercise is another part of a good sleep hygiene program. However, choosing the times of day that you exercise is important. Exercising in the late afternoon can make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep. However, exercise within a few hours (about 2 to 4 hours) before going to sleep may actually make it more difficult to get a good night's sleep. People who exercise regularly, in general, have less incidence and risk for insomnia.

</p><br>
<h1 align="center">HOW TO SLEEP BETTER: FOODS TO AVOID</h1>
<img src="Images/sleep11.jpg" align="middle">
<p>Food and drink make up another aspect of good sleep hygiene. Foods to avoid are those containing caffeine (coffee, tea, and soda drinks), heavy (large quantity) evening meals, spicy foods, and alcohol consumption. Alcohol may cause some people to become sleepy but it can lead to early nighttime awakening.

</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">HOW TO SLEEP BETTER: REDUCE TECHNOLOGY BEFORE BED</h1>
<img src="Images/sleep12.jpg" align="middle">
<p>Another aspect of good sleep hygiene is to reduce items that may stimulate you to think or act right before bedtime. Perhaps one of the best examples is late-night television. Some programming may increase mental alertness or cause you to think about subjects. Similar situations occur with children playing video games right before bed or teenagers and/or adults using computers, cell phones, or tablets.
<br>
Good sleep hygiene suggests you start reducing brain stimulation as you prepare to go to sleep. Sleep researchers suggest you stop using TV, video games, or the Internet about an hour or so before going to bed; others suggest individuals should prepare for bed by reading and by prohibiting TVs or computer use in the bedroom.
