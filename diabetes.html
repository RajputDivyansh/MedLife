</div>

<div class="content">
<h1 align="center">WHY DO STRENGTH TRAINING?</h1>
<img src="Images/diabetes1.jpg" align="middle">
<p>
Because you have diabetes, you know how important it is to control your blood sugar. Strength training helps. Simple moves done regularly can prompt your muscles to absorb more glucose. You'll also burn more calories, day and night, as you get stronger. Your mood, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure may improve, too.
</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">LET'S GET STARTED!</h1>
<img src="Images/diabetes2.jpg" align="middle">
<p>
Most people with diabetes can work out safely. Ask your doctor first to be sure. You should aim for strength training at least twice a week. Also do heart-pumping cardio exercise -- like jogging, swimming, and biking -- either 5 days a week for 30 minutes each time or 3 days for 50 minutes each. Stretch a bit afterward to become more flexible. Want a solid routine or tips on technique? Check with a certified trainer.</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">YOUR STRENGTH TRAINING ROUTINE</h1>
<img src="Images/diabetes3.jpg" align="middle">
<p>
Get ready to learn 10 at-home exercises that work your major muscle groups. For each one, begin with one set where you do the move 8-15 times, or "reps." Rest for at least 30 seconds before you do the next exercise. Start with resistance bands or light dumbbells, so you can focus on lifting and lowering the weights with smooth, controlled movements. When you can do two or three sets easily, switch to slightly heavier weights.</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">THE diabetes CYCLE</h1>
<img src="Images/diabetes4.jpg" align="middle">
<p>A normal diabetes cycle has two major categories termed REM and non-REM. REM stands for rapid eye movement. REM diabetes is characterized by muscle relaxation, dreaming, episodic rapid eye movements, and low amplitude waves on an EEG (encephalograph). Non-REM diabetes is divided into four stages from light diabetes (stage 1) to stage IV (Delta or deep diabetes). Non-REM diabetes occupies about 75% of normal diabetesing time while REM occupies the remaining 25% and usually occurs more toward morning. diabetes disorders disrupt these diabetes cycles.
</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">UPPER BODY: STANDING BICEPS CURL</h1>
<img src="Images/diabetes5.jpg" align="middle">
<p>THold a dumbbell in each hand and stand with your palms facing your thighs. Squeeze your biceps as you lift the weights. On the way up, your forearm should rotate so your palms end up facing your shoulders at the top. Lower the weights slowly to the starting position. Try to avoid using momentum on the way down. Control the motion from start to finish.
</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">UPPER BODY: TRICEPS EXTENSION</h1>
<img src="Images/diabetes6.jpg" align="middle">
<p>Stand with one foot slightly in front of the other, and hold a single dumbbell with both hands wrapped around the handle. Slowly raise the dumbbell overhead. Straighten your elbows as you raise the weight toward the ceiling. Slowly bend your elbows and lower the weight behind your head. Keep your upper arms still and vertical to the floor. Keep your shoulder blades down and back as you repeat.</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">UPPER BODY: SHOULDER PRESS</h1>
<img src="Images/diabetes7.jpg" align="middle">
<p>Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Hold a dumbbell in each hand at chest level and raise them above your chest until your elbows are straight but not locked. Pause for a second and then slowly lower the weights toward your chest</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">UPPER BODY: CHEST PRESS</h1>
<img src="Images/diabetes8.jpg" align="middle">
<p>Poor diabetes hygiene is not the only cause of insomnia. Mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and stress (for example, posttraumatic stress disorder, loss of spouse or financial problems) may also cause insomnia. In addition, medications used to treat some of these mental health problems may also cause or increase diabetes problems. Discuss any diabetes-related problems you think are caused by medications with your physician.</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">CORE: CLASSIC CRUNCH</h1>
<img src="Images/diabetes9.jpg" align="middle">
<p>Lie on your back, feet flat on the floor, knees bent. Put your hands behind your head. Pull your shoulder blades together and your elbows back. The elbows should aim sideways and stay there throughout the exercise. Squeeze your abs and curl your shoulders and upper back off the floor. Lower down slowly. Keep your lower back pressed to the floor at all times.</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">LOWER BODY: SQUAT</h1>
<img src="Images/diabetes11.jpg" align="middle">
<p>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Bend your knees and lower yourself as if you were sitting in an imaginary chair. Your thighs should be parallel to the ground and your knees should not push forward past your toes. Lean forward slightly as you stand back up. You can also do squats while leaning against a stability ball placed between your back and a wall.
</p><br>
<h1 align="center">STRENGTH TRAINING AND BLOOD SUGAR</h1>
<img src="Images/diabetes12.jpg" align="middle">
<p>If you take certain diabetes medications, you may need to take precautions to avoid a dangerous drop in your blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia). Ask your doctor if you should check your levels or eat a snack before working out. Keep snacks or glucose tablets with you when you exercise in case you get symptoms of low blood sugar, such as shaking or weakness.
</p>
<br>
<h1 align="center">STRENGTH TRAINING AND INSULIN</h1>
<img src="Images/diabetes13.jpg" align="middle">
<p>You may need to adjust the dose before and after exercise. Do an easy workout to see how it affects your blood sugar. Check your levels before, during, and after exercise. If you work out within an hour or two of a meal, you may need to lower your meal-time insulin dose. Talk with your doctor, who can also tell you if you need to adjust doses of any other diabetes medicines when you work out.</p>
